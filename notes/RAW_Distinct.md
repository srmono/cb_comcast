In Couchbase N1QL, `SELECT RAW` and `SELECT element` are both used for querying data, but they differ in how they return the result set.

### 1. **`SELECT element`**
   - This is the typical form of a `SELECT` statement in N1QL.
   - It returns the result as a structured object, such as a document or specific fields from the document, wrapped inside an array of objects.
   
   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT name, age FROM `bucket_name` WHERE type = 'user';
   ```
   - **Result:**
   ```json
   [
     { "name": "John", "age": 30 },
     { "name": "Jane", "age": 25 }
   ]
   ```

   Here, each result row is returned as an object (or JSON document) inside an array, and the fields you selected (`name` and `age`) are present as key-value pairs.

### 2. **`SELECT RAW`**
   - `SELECT RAW` is used when you want to return the value directly, without any wrapping or extra metadata.
   - It returns the selected field(s) or value(s) without wrapping them inside an object. The result is essentially a flattened array of values.
   
   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT RAW name FROM `bucket_name` WHERE type = 'user';
   ```
   - **Result:**
   ```json
   [
     "John",
     "Jane"
   ]
   ```

   Instead of returning an array of objects, it directly returns an array of the raw values of the `name` field. Each element in the result array is a single value (`John` and `Jane`), not an object with a `name` key.

### Key Differences:
1. **Structure of Output:**
   - **`SELECT element`:** Returns the selected fields wrapped in objects (i.e., structured as key-value pairs).
   - **`SELECT RAW`:** Returns raw values without the key wrapping, which is useful when you only need the value itself.

2. **Use Cases:**
   - **`SELECT element`:** Use this when you need structured data (e.g., when querying multiple fields or want results in key-value form).
   - **`SELECT RAW`:** Use this when you want only the raw values from a single field (or expression), especially when you're dealing with one field, like a list of names, IDs, or other singular values.

### Example with More Context:
Consider a document like this:

```json
{
  "type": "user",
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30
}
```

- **`SELECT element` Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT name FROM `bucket_name` WHERE type = 'user';
   ```
   - **Result:**
   ```json
   [
     { "name": "John" }
   ]
   ```

- **`SELECT RAW` Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT RAW name FROM `bucket_name` WHERE type = 'user';
   ```
   - **Result:**
   ```json
   [
     "John"
   ]
   ```

`SELECT RAW` eliminates the need for the additional key-value wrapping, which can simplify the result if you're only interested in the values.
