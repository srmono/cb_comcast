Let's break down the `docker run` command to understand it clearly, especially with regard to port mapping, and then I'll explain about port `13210` specifically.

### **Command Breakdown:**
```
docker run -d --name remote -p 9091-9096:8091-8096 -p 13210-13211:11210-11211 couchbase:enterprise-7.0.2
```

1. **`-d`**: 
   - This flag runs the container in detached mode, meaning it runs in the background.
   
2. **`--name remote`**: 
   - This sets the name of the container to `remote`. It helps you easily reference the container later.

3. **`-p 9091-9096:8091-8096`**: 
   - This maps the **host machine's ports (9091-9096)** to the **container's Couchbase ports (8091-8096)**.
   - **Couchbase Ports 8091-8096** are important for Couchbase's web UI, REST API, and management:
     - **8091**: Web UI, REST API, and cluster management.
     - **8092**: Couchbase Views API.
     - **8093**: Query Service (N1QL query engine).
     - **8094**: Search Service (FTS).
     - **8095**: Analytics Service.
     - **8096**: Eventing Service.
   
   In this example, when you access the host machine's port `9091`, it forwards the request to the Couchbase container's port `8091`, and so on up to port `9096`.

4. **`-p 13210-13211:11210-11211`**: 
   - This maps the **host machine's ports (13210-13211)** to the **container's Couchbase ports (11210-11211)**.
   - **Couchbase Ports 11210-11211** are critical for data operations:
     - **11210**: Couchbase Data Service (binary protocol) used for key-value operations.
     - **11211**: This is the Memcached binary protocol used in Couchbase (if Memcached buckets are enabled).

   This part of the command maps **host port 13210** to the **container's Couchbase port 11210** and **host port 13211** to **container port 11211**.

### **Explaining Port 13210**
- **Port 13210** (on the host machine) is mapped to **port 11210** inside the Couchbase container. 
  - **Port 11210** is the default port for the **Couchbase Data Service**. It handles key-value operations (KV protocol), which is essential for reading and writing documents to/from Couchbase.
  
  - **Is 13210 a default port in Couchbase?** No. **13210** is not a default Couchbase port. It is an arbitrary port you've assigned on the **host machine** for forwarding traffic to **port 11210** in the container.
  
  - **Can you choose any port for this purpose?** Yes. You can map any available port on the **host machine** to the Couchbase container’s **port 11210** (the Couchbase Data Service). In this case, you chose port `13210` for this purpose, but you could have chosen any other available port.

### **Summary of the Ports:**

- **Ports 8091-8096 (in the container)**: These are the standard Couchbase service ports used for web UI, query, search, analytics, and eventing.
  - You map these ports to the host ports 9091-9096, so you can access Couchbase services on the host machine using ports 9091-9096.
  
- **Ports 11210-11211 (in the container)**: These are default Couchbase ports for data operations (11210) and the Memcached protocol (11211).
  - You map these ports to the host ports 13210-13211. However, the host ports (e.g., 13210) are not Couchbase defaults, just ports you chose to forward traffic to the respective container ports.

---

### **Additional Point About Port 13210:**
- **Is port 13210 for a specific Couchbase purpose?**
  - No, **13210 is not a default Couchbase port**. It is just a port on your **host machine** that you’ve chosen to map to Couchbase's **default port 11210** (used for data operations) inside the container.
  
- **Can you use a different port number?**
  - Yes, you can use **any available port** on your host machine (e.g., `15000`, `30000`) to map to Couchbase’s default port `11210` inside the container. The port you choose on the host does not need to match Couchbase’s internal ports as long as the mapping is correct.
