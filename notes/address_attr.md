Both approaches for the `order` document structure have their pros and cons depending on the specific use cases you want to address.

### 1. **First Approach:**
```json
{
  type: "order",
  shipping_address: "",
  billing_address: ""
}
```
This approach is simpler and more straightforward. You directly store the `shipping_address` and `billing_address` as separate fields in the document.

**Advantages:**
- **Simplicity:** The structure is clean and easy to understand. It’s ideal when the distinction between `shipping_address` and `billing_address` is always required.
- **Direct Access:** Accessing either address is straightforward (`order.shipping_address` and `order.billing_address`), which can lead to faster reads and simpler queries.

**Drawbacks:**
- **Limited Flexibility:** If you need to extend the document to handle more types of addresses in the future (e.g., secondary shipping addresses or other types), it would require additional fields.
- **Redundancy in Logic:** Repeated logic is needed if more address types are introduced.

**Use Case:**
- This approach works well when there are fixed address types that don’t change often, such as when you always deal with a single shipping and billing address for each order.

### 2. **Second Approach:**
```json
{
  type: "order",
  addresses: [
    { type: "shipping_address" },
    { type: "billing_address" }
  ]
}
```
This approach uses an array to store multiple address objects, each with a `type` field to distinguish between `shipping_address` and `billing_address`.

**Advantages:**
- **Flexibility:** This structure is more flexible, allowing you to store multiple types of addresses or even multiple instances of the same address type (e.g., multiple shipping addresses).
- **Scalability:** If more address types are introduced in the future, they can easily be added to the array without requiring schema changes.

**Drawbacks:**
- **Query Complexity:** Accessing addresses will require querying the array and filtering by `type`, which can add complexity to the code and queries (`order.addresses[0].type == "shipping_address"`).
- **Performance:** Depending on the size of the array and frequency of access, performance may be slightly impacted due to the need for array traversal.

**Use Case:**
- This design is more suitable if you anticipate that your system may require more address types, multiple addresses, or if the data model needs to be more extensible and flexible.

### **Which One to Use?**
- **First Approach:** Choose this when the order will always have one `shipping_address` and one `billing_address`, and simplicity is preferred.
- **Second Approach:** Opt for this when the document needs to be more dynamic, allowing for multiple address types or future extensions to the address structure. This is ideal for complex, evolving requirements.
