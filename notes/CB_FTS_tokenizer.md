In Couchbase Full-Text Search (FTS), custom analyzers allow you to control how text is processed for indexing and searching. Tokenizers play a crucial role in breaking down text into individual units (tokens) that can be indexed. The tokenization step is essential for understanding how the text can be searched effectively.

### Types of Tokenizers in Custom Analyzers for FTS:

Couchbase provides various tokenizers that you can use in a **custom analyzer** to suit different types of text processing requirements. Below are the common tokenizers available in Couchbase FTS:

---

### 1. **Whitespace Tokenizer**
   - **Description**: Splits the input text at each occurrence of whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.).
   - **Use Case**: Best used when you want to tokenize based purely on spaces. This tokenizer works well for simple word tokenization where you don't want any special handling of punctuation.
   - **Example**:
     - Input: `"Full-Text Search in Couchbase"`
     - Tokens: `"Full-Text"`, `"Search"`, `"in"`, `"Couchbase"`

---

### 2. **Single Character Tokenizer**
   - **Description**: Breaks down the input text into individual characters, treating each character as a token.
   - **Use Case**: Useful when every single character in a string needs to be searchable. This tokenizer might be used in cases like indexing product codes, serial numbers, or very fine-grained text analysis.
   - **Example**:
     - Input: `"FTS"`
     - Tokens: `"F"`, `"T"`, `"S"`

---

### 3. **Unicode Tokenizer**
   - **Description**: A tokenizer based on Unicode text segmentation rules. It splits text into tokens based on Unicode standard definitions, allowing for multi-language support. It can handle complex scripts and is ideal for internationalization.
   - **Use Case**: This tokenizer is suited for text in multiple languages and scripts, where handling of accented characters, non-Latin alphabets, and complex tokenization rules is required.
   - **Example**:
     - Input: `"Café"`
     - Tokens: `"Café"`

---

### 4. **Letter Tokenizer**
   - **Description**: Tokenizes text based on letters, separating the input at any non-letter character. Non-letter characters (numbers, punctuation, etc.) are not included in the output tokens.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for cases where you only want to index and search alphabetic words, ignoring digits and special characters.
   - **Example**:
     - Input: `"User123 said: Hello!"`
     - Tokens: `"User"`, `"said"`, `"Hello"`

---

### 5. **Keyword Tokenizer**
   - **Description**: Treats the entire input as a single token. It does not break up the input text, making it useful when you want the entire string to be treated as a single searchable term.
   - **Use Case**: Typically used when dealing with identifiers, codes, URLs, or strings where the entire value should be indexed as one term.
   - **Example**:
     - Input: `"my_custom_keyword"`
     - Tokens: `"my_custom_keyword"`

---

### 6. **Edge N-gram Tokenizer**
   - **Description**: Tokenizes text by creating n-grams from the beginning of each word. For example, for the word `"search"`, it can create n-grams like `"se"`, `"sea"`, `"sear"`, etc.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for prefix matching (e.g., when you want to autocomplete or search as you type).
   - **Example**:
     - Input: `"search"`
     - Tokens: `"s"`, `"se"`, `"sea"`, `"sear"`, `"searc"`, `"search"`

---

### 7. **N-gram Tokenizer**
   - **Description**: Splits the input into overlapping n-grams of a specified length. It breaks down text into n-length substrings regardless of word boundaries.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for fuzzy searches or misspelling handling. It can be used when you want to search for parts of words or when exact matches are not required.
   - **Example**:
     - Input: `"Couchbase"`
     - Tokens (for n=3): `"Cou"`, `"ouc"`, `"uch"`, `"chb"`, `"hba"`, `"bas"`, `"ase"`

---

### 8. **Pattern Tokenizer**
   - **Description**: Splits the text based on a custom-defined regular expression pattern.
   - **Use Case**: Offers flexibility to tokenize text based on specific patterns. For example, you can tokenize based on punctuation, specific characters, or sequences.
   - **Example**:
     - Input: `"email@example.com"`
     - Tokens (with pattern splitting at `@`): `"email"`, `"example.com"`

---

### 9. **Delimited Tokenizer**
   - **Description**: Breaks text into tokens based on a delimiter, such as a comma, semicolon, or any specified character.
   - **Use Case**: Useful when tokenizing comma-separated values or delimited text formats like CSV files.
   - **Example**:
     - Input: `"apple,banana,cherry"`
     - Tokens: `"apple"`, `"banana"`, `"cherry"`

---

### Choosing the Right Tokenizer:
The tokenizer you choose depends on the structure and nature of the text you're dealing with. For example:
- If you’re working with plain text and need basic word-level tokenization, the **Whitespace Tokenizer** is simple and efficient.
- For internationalized content, **Unicode Tokenizer** is more appropriate.
- If you need to handle autocomplete or search-as-you-type scenarios, consider **Edge N-gram**.

### Tokenizer Customization:
Some tokenizers, like N-gram or Pattern, allow you to configure the specific behavior (e.g., length of the n-grams or the regular expression used), giving you more control over how tokens are created.
