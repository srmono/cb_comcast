Couchbase instance on **Windows** (locally) and the other inside **Docker**, the key challenge is likely due to networking between the Docker container and your Windows machine. Docker on Windows (especially with Docker Desktop) uses a virtualized environment, which can lead to some networking complexities. Let's troubleshoot and solve this step by step:

### Steps to Resolve the Couchbase Node Addition Issue on Windows and Docker

#### 1. **Check Docker Container Network Configuration**
   Docker containers on Windows often run in a virtualized environment (using a virtual network). By default, they are not part of the same network as your host machine (Windows). There are a couple of network options you can try:

   - **Bridge Network (Default)**
     - This is the default Docker network. Containers are isolated from the host, and you need to expose ports to communicate with the container.
     - If using a bridge network, you must make sure Couchbase ports are **forwarded** correctly.
     - You can check the Docker container's IP using:
       ```bash
       docker inspect <container-name> | grep IPAddress
       ```

     - To ensure proper port forwarding, run the Couchbase container with the following command:
       ```bash
       docker run -d --name couchbase-node -p 8091-8096:8091-8096 -p 11210:11210 couchbase
       ```

     This exposes Couchbase's default ports to your Windows machine.

   - **Host Network Mode**
     - This is a simpler option but is only available on **Linux**. If you're using Windows, the host network option does not work with Docker Desktop.

#### 2. **Verify Ports are Exposed**
   Couchbase uses several ports for communication between nodes:
   - 8091-8096: Couchbase management, admin, REST API
   - 11210: Data exchange between nodes
   - 11207: For secured data exchange (SSL/TLS)

   Make sure that your Couchbase Docker container is running with the proper ports exposed and that your Windows firewall is not blocking these ports. Here’s how you can check the ports:
   - Inside Docker, you can inspect the container ports by running:
     ```bash
     docker ps
     ```

   Ensure these ports are properly open and forwarded on both your Windows host and Docker container.

#### 3. **Connect to Docker Couchbase from Windows**
   After verifying that the container is running and the ports are exposed:
   - In your browser, try accessing the Couchbase web UI running inside Docker:
     ```
     http://localhost:8091
     ```
   - If you used `-p <host-port>:<container-port>` in your `docker run` command, you should be able to access the Couchbase UI from the host machine (Windows).

   If that doesn’t work, you may need to use the **Docker container's IP address** instead of `localhost`. You can get the Docker container’s IP address using:
   ```bash
   docker inspect <container-id> | grep IPAddress
   ```
   Then try to access it via:
   ```
   http://<container-ip>:8091
   ```

#### 4. **Ensure Couchbase Node Configuration is Proper**
   When adding a new node to your Couchbase cluster (either from the Windows Couchbase instance or the Docker one), make sure you are using the correct IP addresses and ports for both nodes.

   - To **add the Docker Couchbase node** to your local Windows Couchbase instance, follow these steps:
     1. Open the Couchbase Web UI on your Windows machine (`http://localhost:8091`).
     2. Go to **Servers** → **Add Server**.
     3. Enter the **IP address** of the Docker Couchbase instance (the IP you retrieved from the `docker inspect` command).
     4. Enter the Couchbase credentials (username and password).

   - Similarly, to **add the Windows Couchbase node** to your Docker Couchbase instance:
     1. Open the Couchbase Web UI for the Docker instance (using either `localhost` or the container’s IP).
     2. Go to **Servers** → **Add Server**.
     3. Enter the **IP address** of your Windows machine (you can find this by running `ipconfig` on Windows and using the local IP).
     4. Enter the Couchbase credentials.

#### 5. **Firewall and Security Rules**
   Windows firewall could be blocking communication between the Docker container and the local Couchbase instance.

   - **Allow Couchbase Ports in Windows Firewall**:
     1. Open **Windows Defender Firewall** and go to **Advanced settings**.
     2. In **Inbound Rules**, create a new rule to allow traffic on ports **8091-8096** and **11210**.
     3. Do the same for **Outbound Rules**.

   Additionally, if you're running Docker in a virtualized network (which is likely on Windows), ensure that your Docker container can reach your Windows machine’s IP over these ports.

#### 6. **Verify Couchbase Versions**
   Ensure both the local Couchbase instance (on Windows) and the Couchbase instance running in Docker are using the **same version**. Nodes must run compatible versions for clustering to work properly. If you’re unsure about the versions:
   - Check the Couchbase version in the **web console** under the **Servers** section or in the **About** section.

#### 7. **Add Node via Couchbase CLI (Optional)**
   If the web UI isn’t working, you can also try adding the node via the Couchbase CLI.

   On your Windows machine, open the command prompt and run:
   ```bash
   couchbase-cli server-add -c <windows-ip>:8091 \
     --username <admin-username> --password <admin-password> \
     --server-add <docker-container-ip>:8091 \
     --server-add-username <admin-username> \
     --server-add-password <admin-password>
   ```

   Make sure to replace `<windows-ip>` and `<docker-container-ip>` with the appropriate IP addresses for your Windows and Docker instances.

### Summary of Key Points:
- Ensure Docker networking is properly configured with ports exposed.
- Verify that Windows and Docker Couchbase instances can communicate over required ports.
- Use the correct IP addresses when adding nodes (either Docker container IP or Windows IP).
- Check firewall settings on Windows to allow traffic on Couchbase ports.
- Ensure both Couchbase instances are running compatible versions.
