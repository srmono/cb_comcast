In Couchbase, **operators** and **clauses** are crucial components of query language, especially when dealing with N1QL (the SQL-like query language used in Couchbase). Below is an overview of key operators and clauses used in Couchbase.

### 1. **Operators in Couchbase N1QL**
Operators help in performing operations on data, whether for comparisons, arithmetic, or logical evaluations.

#### **Comparison Operators**
- `=`: Equal to
- `!=` or `<>`: Not equal to
- `<`: Less than
- `<=`: Less than or equal to
- `>`: Greater than
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to

#### **Logical Operators**
- `AND`: Logical AND operation between two expressions
- `OR`: Logical OR operation between two expressions
- `NOT`: Logical NOT operation to negate the result of an expression

#### **Arithmetic Operators**
- `+`: Addition
- `-`: Subtraction
- `*`: Multiplication
- `/`: Division
- `%`: Modulus (remainder after division)

#### **IN Operator**
- Used to match any value within a list or subquery.
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM bucket WHERE name IN ['John', 'Jane']`

#### **LIKE Operator**
- Used to match patterns in strings using wildcards (`%` for multiple characters, `_` for a single character).
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM bucket WHERE name LIKE 'Jo%'`

#### **IS NULL / IS NOT NULL**
- Checks if a field is `NULL`.
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM bucket WHERE age IS NULL`

#### **BETWEEN Operator**
- Used to find a range of values (inclusive).
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM bucket WHERE age BETWEEN 20 AND 30`

#### **ARRAY Operators**
- `ANY`: Used to check if any element in an array satisfies a condition.
- `EVERY`: Used to check if all elements in an array satisfy a condition.
- `ARRAY`: Used to construct an array from a query.
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM bucket WHERE ANY v IN array_field SATISFIES v > 10 END`

### 2. **Clauses in Couchbase N1QL**
Clauses help to structure the queries in N1QL, much like in SQL.

#### **SELECT Clause**
- The core clause to retrieve documents or fields from Couchbase.
  - Example: `SELECT name, age FROM bucket WHERE age > 30`

#### **FROM Clause**
- Specifies the data source (i.e., bucket or collection) from which data is queried.
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` WHERE country = 'USA'`

#### **WHERE Clause**
- Defines the filter or condition for querying data.
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM bucket WHERE age > 30`

#### **GROUP BY Clause**
- Used to group results based on one or more fields.
  - Example: `SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM bucket GROUP BY city`

#### **HAVING Clause**
- Filters the results after applying aggregation (`GROUP BY`).
  - Example: `SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM bucket GROUP BY city HAVING COUNT(*) > 5`

#### **ORDER BY Clause**
- Orders the result set by one or more fields.
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM bucket WHERE age > 30 ORDER BY age DESC`

#### **LIMIT and OFFSET Clauses**
- `LIMIT` is used to restrict the number of rows returned.
- `OFFSET` skips a specified number of rows.
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM bucket WHERE age > 30 ORDER BY age LIMIT 10 OFFSET 5`

#### **JOIN Clause**
- Combines rows from two or more collections (buckets) based on a related field.
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM bucket1 AS b1 JOIN bucket2 AS b2 ON b1.id = b2.id`

### Example Query using Operators and Clauses
```sql
SELECT name, age 
FROM `travel-sample` 
WHERE country = 'USA' 
AND age BETWEEN 25 AND 35 
ORDER BY age DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

This query retrieves the `name` and `age` of users from the `travel-sample` bucket where the country is 'USA' and the age is between 25 and 35, orders the results by age in descending order, and limits the results to 10 rows.

You're right! I missed some important parts like the **`LET` clause** and specific **equality operators**. Let me provide a more detailed explanation, covering those as well.

### **1. `LET` Clause**
The `LET` clause in Couchbase's N1QL allows you to define variables or intermediate expressions within your query, which can then be referenced later in the query. This is similar to defining a variable or alias for values, helping you avoid recalculating expressions or making your query more readable.

#### Usage of `LET` Clause
- **Syntax**: 
  ```sql
  LET var_name = expression
  ```
- **Purpose**: You can assign a computed value, function result, or subquery to a variable and then use that variable in the `SELECT`, `WHERE`, or other clauses.

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT name, age, country, fullName
FROM `travel-sample`
LET fullName = firstName || ' ' || lastName
WHERE age > 30;
```
In this query:
- We define a variable `fullName` in the `LET` clause, which concatenates `firstName` and `lastName`.
- The `fullName` variable can be used in the `SELECT` clause instead of calculating it multiple times.

The `LET` clause is often used in complex queries where an intermediate value is needed in different parts of the query.

### **2. Equality Operators**
Equality operators in Couchbase are used to compare values or expressions to check if they are equal or not. These include standard operators like `=` for equality, but there are additional forms, including strict equality and inequality.

#### **Standard Equality and Inequality Operators**
- `=`: Checks if the values of two expressions are equal.
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM bucket WHERE age = 30`
- `!=` or `<>`: Checks if two expressions are **not equal**.
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM bucket WHERE name != 'John'`
  
#### **Strict Equality Operators**
- **IS NOT DISTINCT FROM**: Checks if two values are equal, **including `NULL` values**. This operator is particularly useful when you need to handle `NULL` as a legitimate value.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM bucket 
    WHERE name IS NOT DISTINCT FROM 'John';  -- Will match both 'John' and NULLs
    ```

- **IS DISTINCT FROM**: This operator checks if two values are **not equal**, treating `NULL` as a valid comparison. Unlike `!=`, it will return `true` even if one of the values is `NULL` (i.e., `NULL` is not equal to any value).
  - Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM bucket 
    WHERE name IS DISTINCT FROM 'John';  -- Will match rows where name is not 'John', including rows with NULL
    ```

---

### **3. More on Operators**
In addition to standard equality operators, Couchbase offers a few more that help with specific types of comparisons:

#### **Array Equality Operators**
- `IN` Operator: Checks if a value exists in a list or array.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM bucket WHERE age IN [25, 30, 35];
    ```

- **Array Function Operators**: Used to check conditions within arrays, such as `ANY`, `EVERY`, `ARRAY`, etc.
  - Example with `ANY`:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM bucket 
    WHERE ANY v IN interests SATISFIES v = 'travel' END;
    ```

---

### **4. Example Query Using `LET`, Equality, and Other Operators**
```sql
SELECT name, age, country, fullName
FROM `travel-sample`
LET fullName = firstName || ' ' || lastName
WHERE age > 30
  AND country IS NOT DISTINCT FROM 'USA'
  AND ANY interest IN interests SATISFIES interest = 'travel' END
ORDER BY age DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Explanation:
1. **`LET`**: We define `fullName` as the concatenation of `firstName` and `lastName`.
2. **`WHERE`**: We filter results:
   - `age > 30`
   - `country IS NOT DISTINCT FROM 'USA'` (matches `USA` or `NULL`)
   - We also check if the user has 'travel' as an interest using the `ANY` operator.
3. **`ORDER BY`**: We sort the results by `age` in descending order.
4. **`LIMIT`**: We limit the results to 10 rows.
