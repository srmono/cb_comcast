Couchbase 7 introduced several new features and architectural enhancements compared to Couchbase 6, marking a significant upgrade. Below is a detailed comparison between **Couchbase 6** and **Couchbase 7** across key dimensions.

### 1. **Data Organization: Collections and Scopes**
- **Couchbase 6**: 
  - No formal structure for organizing data beyond **buckets**. A bucket in Couchbase 6 is a flat namespace that holds all documents, making data organization more challenging for complex use cases.
  - Developers had to emulate collections and schemas using application-side logic, which increased complexity.

- **Couchbase 7**:
  - **Introduced Scopes and Collections**: This feature allows you to organize documents more effectively.
    - **Bucket**: Still the top-level container (equivalent to a database).
    - **Scope**: A logical grouping of collections (similar to schemas in a relational database).
    - **Collection**: Represents a group of documents (similar to tables in a relational database).
  - This formal data hierarchy significantly improves multi-tenancy support and data organization. It allows different applications or tenants to have separate collections while sharing the same bucket.

### 2. **Distributed ACID Transactions**
- **Couchbase 6**:
  - Limited support for ACID transactions.
  - Only **single-document** ACID transactions were supported, ensuring that individual document updates are atomic and isolated.
  
- **Couchbase 7**:
  - Introduced **multi-document ACID transactions** across multiple collections or scopes. This is a major advancement for enterprise applications requiring consistency guarantees across multiple documents and operations.
  - Ensures atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) for complex transactions that span multiple documents, collections, and scopes.
  
  Example:
  ```java
  cluster.transactions().run((ctx) -> {
      ctx.insert(collection, "docKey1", document1);
      ctx.replace(collection, "docKey2", document2);
      ctx.commit();  // Ensures that both operations succeed or none are applied
  });
  ```

### 3. **Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)**
- **Couchbase 6**:
  - Couchbase 6 introduced the concept of **Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)**, allowing different services (Data, Query, Index, etc.) to be deployed and scaled independently on different nodes. This allowed optimal resource allocation for various workloads.
  - However, data organization (lack of collections and scopes) limited MDS effectiveness in certain scenarios.
  
- **Couchbase 7**:
  - MDS is further enhanced by better **query optimization** and more granular control through the introduction of collections and scopes.
  - **MDS combined with collections** provides better scaling for individual services (Query, Indexing, Data, etc.) by enabling finer data segmentation at the collection level.
  
### 4. **Query Performance & N1QL Enhancements**
- **Couchbase 6**:
  - Supported N1QL (SQL-like query language) but queries were primarily executed at the bucket level.
  - Indexes were created on the bucket, which could make queries over large datasets slower in some cases, particularly when you only needed to query a specific subset of documents.

- **Couchbase 7**:
  - **Collection-Level Queries**: With the introduction of collections, N1QL queries can now be scoped to specific collections, improving performance for targeted queries.
  - **Better Indexing**: Indexes can now be built on collections and scopes, which improves query execution times and reduces the overall system overhead.
  - **Advanced Query Features**: Couchbase 7 also brings more advanced N1QL features such as window functions and improved subquery handling.
  
  Example of querying a specific collection in Couchbase 7:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM `bucket`.`scope`.`collection` WHERE field = 'value';
  ```

### 5. **Data Durability Options**
- **Couchbase 6**:
  - Provided configurable **durability levels** (None, Majority, Majority and Persist to Active, etc.).
  - **Replication** and **disk persistence** options were available for ensuring durability, but replication could only be configured at the bucket level.

- **Couchbase 7**:
  - Improved control over durability, especially with the introduction of collections.
  - **Durability configurations** can now be fine-tuned at the collection level, offering more granular control over the level of consistency and durability across various parts of an application.
  - Additionally, the introduction of **transactions** in Couchbase 7 further enhances durability guarantees across multiple operations.

### 6. **Eventing and Real-Time Processing**
- **Couchbase 6**:
  - Introduced **Eventing Service** to respond to real-time changes in the database, allowing developers to define event-handling functions that are triggered by changes in the data (e.g., document creation, updates, deletions).
  
- **Couchbase 7**:
  - Eventing Service continues to be an important feature but is better integrated with **collections** and **scopes**.
  - **Event handlers** can now be scoped to specific collections, giving more granular control over which data triggers event processing. This makes event handling more precise and efficient in multi-tenant or multi-collection use cases.

### 7. **Improved Indexing**
- **Couchbase 6**:
  - Indexing in Couchbase 6 allowed for **Global Secondary Indexes (GSI)**, but indexes were typically created at the bucket level, which could lead to inefficient index usage for large datasets.
  - Supported memory-optimized and disk-based indexes.

- **Couchbase 7**:
  - **Collection-Aware Indexing**: Indexes can now be defined at the collection level, allowing for more efficient queries. This helps in isolating index workloads to specific collections rather than indexing an entire bucket.
  - **Deferred Index Creation**: Couchbase 7 offers more advanced options for deferred index creation, allowing developers to create indexes at a later point when data is more stable, reducing overhead during large write operations.

### 8. **Security Enhancements**
- **Couchbase 6**:
  - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** was available but at the bucket level. This allowed you to control who had access to different buckets, but finer control within buckets was limited.
  - Data encryption for **data in transit** and **at rest** was supported.

- **Couchbase 7**:
  - **Collection-Level RBAC**: With collections, security has been enhanced. You can now set fine-grained permissions at the collection and scope level, providing much better control over data access.
  - **Audit Logs** and enhanced security features to ensure compliance, particularly important for enterprises with stricter security and regulatory requirements.

### 9. **Cross-Data Center Replication (XDCR)**
- **Couchbase 6**:
  - Supported **XDCR** for data replication across clusters in different regions or data centers, useful for disaster recovery and geo-replication.
  
- **Couchbase 7**:
  - XDCR now supports replication at the **scope** and **collection level**, allowing more fine-grained control over what data gets replicated. This reduces overhead in multi-tenant and multi-application environments by allowing only the relevant parts of a dataset to be replicated.

### 10. **Analytics Service**
- **Couchbase 6**:
  - **Analytics Service** was available but without fine-grained control over collections.
  
- **Couchbase 7**:
  - Analytics Service now works with **scopes and collections**, enabling real-time and ad-hoc analysis over specific parts of the data.
  - This ensures that analytics queries can focus on specific collections, avoiding unnecessary overhead on unrelated data.

### 11. **Full-Text Search (FTS)**
- **Couchbase 6**:
  - Full-text search (FTS) was available but functioned at the bucket level.
  
- **Couchbase 7**:
  - **Collection-Level FTS**: Full-text search indexes can now be defined at the collection level, providing more precise search indexing and improving performance by limiting the search scope to specific collections.
